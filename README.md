# Calendar Poll

A hacked together Python site built on the Google App Engine framework to help users organise events with as little fuss as possible. The calendar is supposed to mimic the iPhone month-view calendar in its appearance and behaviour. Calendars go 'live' using AJAX and a randomly generated token, with a rudimentary security check in place. Feel free to do whatever you please with any of the code here.
